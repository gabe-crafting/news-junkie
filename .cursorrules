# Cursor Configuration

## Platform
- Operating System: Windows
- Use Windows-compatible commands (PowerShell/cmd) instead of Linux/Unix commands
- Prefer using Bun when possible (package management, running scripts, etc.)

## React Best Practices
- Prefer solutions using actions (form actions, event handlers) and modern hooks (use, useQuery, etc.) for API fetching and synchronization instead of useEffect when possible
- Avoid useEffect for data fetching or side effects that can be handled with actions or dedicated hooks
- This is a SPA (Single Page Application), no server-side rendering

## TypeScript Rules
- Never use `any` type - use proper types, `unknown`, or `never` instead
